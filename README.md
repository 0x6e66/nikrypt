# nikrypt

This repository seeks to be a cryptography library for learning purposes. First and foremost it is an exercise for me to get more familiar with cryptography. Although I try my best to ensure that the implementations are correct, I am not trying to make a side-channel resistant implementation. So please, for god's sake do **not** use this a a crypto-library in any production environment.
